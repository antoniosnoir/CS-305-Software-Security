# CS-305-Software-Security

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consultation firm that specializes in developing personalized plans relating to their clients’ financial needs. Artemis Financial was seeking to modernize their infrastructure with the latest security options available in order to best protect their client’s private information.

•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I was able to use checksum file verifications and implement keystore.jks. I feel I also correctly identified false positives while running vulnerability checks. It’s important to code securely in order to prevent any opportunity of an attack that can infiltrate the system and steal personal data. Software security adds peace of mind to a company’s overall wellbeing by increasing a company’s positive reputation when talking about security measures taken to maintain client’s data as private as possible.

•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found suppressing false-positives quite tedious and I wish there existed an easier and quicker way to suppress these. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

The first step was running dependency checks, followed by implementing an encryption. In the future, I would analyze the needs for the specific type of company and add layers of security that were deemed most necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured that the code and software application were functional and secure by running the code to make sure that it runs error-free. I also ran static and dynamic tests, refactored the code, and performed the same test cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Maven was instrumental in performing tests to detect vulnerabilities. It’s a tool that is easy enough to implement in future projects. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would showcase the final paper and the keystore.jks file. I would also showcase the use of dependency checkers in order to demonstrate that I can find vulnerabilities.
